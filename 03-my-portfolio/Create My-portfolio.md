01 about me:

From a young age, I have had a deep love for art and a natural eye for detail. My passion for illustration was nurtured by my father and grandfather, who created puppet theaters and custom coloring books for me, sparking my imagination and creativity.

As a child, I attended an art-focused class, which laid the foundation for my journey into graphic design. This passion led me to pursue graphic design in high school and later refine my skills through university studies in the same field.

My lifelong love for creativity and vivid imagination have been key drivers in my artistic development, shaping the designer I am today.


02 About me/my style: 

I love creating projects that evoke emotions, bring my clients' visions to life, and allow me to leave my own artistic mark on the world through my work. While I have a deep appreciation for minimalism and simplicity, I also embrace bold challenges that allow me to unleash my creativity and truly let loose.

Just as every person is unique and extraordinary, I strive to ensure that my projects reflect the same individuality and originality.
