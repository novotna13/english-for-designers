Slide 1: Project Introduction
This project was focused on the rebranding of Letka Café, a well-known coffee shop located in the Letná district of Prague. The goal was to refresh and modernize the visual identity of the café while maintaining its recognizable and warm character. The work was done in a team setting, where I collaborated with three talented creatives: Niki, Teri, and Rita. Each of us contributed a unique skillset to the process, and our teamwork played a key role in pushing the project forward.

Slide 2: The First Round
In the first round of the competition, our main focus was on designing a new logo and visual language. Niki took the lead and designed a custom typeface for the logo that captured the atmosphere and energy of the café. We also introduced the idea of using a bird motif as a central element, symbolizing lightness and freedom — a clever nod to the café’s name Letka, which refers to both a squadron and the Czech word for "flight." Thanks to Niki’s strong direction and the cohesive concept, our project successfully moved on to the second round.

Slide 3: Shifting the Focus – From the Plane to the Details
As we entered the second round, we received feedback that the owners wanted to keep some connection to the airplane theme. However, instead of reusing the entire airplane symbol, I suggested shifting the focus to its mechanical details. I selected the aircraft engine and propeller as key visual elements that could be stylized into something fresh, unexpected, and more visually refined — a way to keep the symbolism without being too literal or obvious.

Slide 4: Creating the New Pattern
Based on that idea, I developed two patterns using the engine and the propeller. The engine design became a strong, structured pattern, while the propeller pattern took on a more decorative form. Rita helped refine the propeller motif by adding ornamental touches that gave the design more rhythm and personality. These elements brought depth and uniqueness to the visual identity, while keeping the core symbolism of flight alive in a more abstract and playful way.

Slide 5: Application & Teamwork Reflection
We applied our new patterns across various brand touchpoints, including packaging mockups and promotional materials. The result was a modern and cohesive visual style that felt both original and authentic to Letka Café. This project gave us valuable real-world experience — from concept development to final design applications. Personally, I’m very grateful to have been part of such an inspiring team of talented women. It was not only a design challenge but also a great collaborative journey that helped each of us grow.
