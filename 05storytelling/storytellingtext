Slide 1: Introduction to My Journey
Welcome to my presentation! I’d like to take you through my personal journey of becoming a graphic designer — a story that started when I was just a child and has developed over many years into a true passion and professional direction. From early artistic experiences in my family to studying design in school and eventually working on real projects, this journey has been full of creative growth, challenges, and valuable lessons. Today, I’m close to completing my bachelor’s degree in graphic design, and I’m excited to share how I got here and what shaped me along the way.

Slide 2: Early Beginnings
My love for creativity and storytelling began in early childhood. My grandfather used to perform puppet shows for me at home, using characters he built by hand. Watching those stories come to life with homemade puppets left a big impact on me — it inspired my imagination and made me want to create characters and worlds of my own. Around the same time, my father played a very important role in my artistic development. He had always wanted to become a graphic designer himself, but back then, there weren’t many opportunities or schools for that profession. Still, he found a way to express his creativity and supported mine fully — making hand-drawn coloring books for me, helping me with drawing, and constantly encouraging me to keep creating. To this day, he continues to give me helpful feedback on my work and motivates me to explore new ideas. These early experiences helped shape not only my skills but also my deep connection to art.

Slide 3: High School – Growth and Doubts
As I got older, my creative path led me to an art-focused high school where I chose the field of graphic design. This time was filled with exploration and development. I learned new techniques and started understanding design on a deeper level. I especially enjoyed using myself as a model in photo and illustration projects — maybe a bit too often! It was a way for me to express emotions and experiment with identity and style.
I also discovered a strong interest in drawing the human figure, especially during live model classes. However, since most of our male models were elderly retirees, it wasn’t always the most inspiring experience, and it left me with a few odd memories! Still, drawing people taught me a lot about observation, anatomy, and character.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, everything changed. Classes moved online, and our school wasn’t fully prepared for the transition. I started to doubt whether graphic design was really for me. The lack of proper feedback and human connection made it harder to stay motivated. But despite that difficult period, I pushed through and completed my studies.

Slide 4: A Turning Point – University Experience
Starting university marked a major turning point in both my personal and creative life. I finally felt like I was in the right place — surrounded by people who shared similar interests and guided by teachers who supported my growth. Here, I was not only able to improve my technical skills but also develop a more professional and strategic approach to design.
One of the most impactful experiences was my internship at the graphic studio Mowshe. It gave me the chance to work on a real and meaningful project: helping with visual materials for the documentary Identita, which tells the story of Czech graphic design. I worked on preparing graphic assets for the animation team, and it was incredibly rewarding to see how my work contributed to the final film. Being credited and attending the film’s premiere made me feel deeply proud and gave me a real sense of purpose within the design world. This experience solidified my commitment to graphic design as a career and opened my eyes to the kinds of projects I want to pursue in the future.

Slide 5: Freelance Work and Personal Passion
Outside of school and internships, I also explored the world of freelance design. Taking on real commissions gave me a whole new perspective. It wasn’t always easy — dealing with clients and managing deadlines was a learning process — but each project helped me grow more confident and professional.
My favorite projects are those related to illustration. Unlike some of the more structured design tasks, illustration allows me to relax, experiment, and express myself more freely. It often feels more like a personal hobby than work, and that’s why I enjoy it so much. Drawing has always been a form of therapy for me, and working on custom illustrations reminds me why I started creating in the first place. One of my biggest dreams is to one day illustrate a children’s book, and every little drawing brings me a step closer to that goal.
These freelance experiences also taught me how to communicate better, manage expectations, and keep my creativity flowing under pressure. All of these lessons are helping me prepare for a future career that combines professionalism with passion — exactly the kind of design work I want to do.
